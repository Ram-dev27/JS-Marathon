**1. What is lexical structure?**

 - The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of elemetary rules that spacifies how you write programs in that language. It is the lowest-level syntax of a language. it specifies what variyables names look like, the delimiter characters for comments, and how one programming statement defer from the next one. 
      EX: Case sensitivity, spaces, line breaks, Comments, Literals, Identifires and reserved words, Unicode, optional semicolons.
   
**2. What is Unicode?**
- The code point is a unique number for a character or some symbol such as an accent mark or ligature. Unicode supports more than a million code points, which are written with a "U" followed a plus sign and the number in hex:
      EX: The word "Hello" is written U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F.
      
**3. List out all the keywords present in the JavaScript.**
  - abstract,	arguments,	await,	boolean, break,	byte,	case,	catch, char,	class,	const,	continue, debugger,	default,	delete,	do, double,	else,	enum,eval,export,	extends,	false,	final, finally,	float,	for,	function, goto,	if,	implements,	import, in,	instanceof,	int,	interface, let,	long,	native,	new,  null,	package,	private,	protected, public,	return,	short,	static, super,	switch,	synchronized,	this, throw,	throws,	transient,	true, try,	typeof,	var,	void, volatile,	while,	with,	yield.
      
**4. What are shorthand operators, explain with a suitable example?**
 - A shorthand operators is a shorter way to express somthing that is already available in the javascript programming language.
      EX:
      x = x + y    ->    x += y,
      x = x - y    ->    x -= y,
      x = x * y    ->    x *= y,
      x = x / y    ->    x /= y,
      x = x % y    ->    x %= y,
      
**5. What is “use Strict” in JavaScript?**
 - Strict mode in JavaScript. ECMAScript 5 introduced the concept of "strict mode". It allows you to place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context. This strict context prevents certain action from being taken and throws more exceptions. Its main purpose is to do more checking.
